Build a full-stack web application that solves real-time collaboration challenges for software teams, specifically:
- reducing code conflicts,
- improving pull-request (PR) reviews,
- helping distributed teams in different time zones,
- aligning on architecture decisions.

🎯 Application Purpose:
This platform should help teams coordinate work, communicate changes clearly, and synchronize on architecture and code updates.

🧩 Core Features:
1. Real-time collaboration board:
   - Kanban-style task board with statuses (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets or serverless WebSocket APIs
   - Team roles (Engineer, Reviewer, Architect)

2. Architecture Decision Log (ADR) Portal:
   - Create, view, and update Architecture Decision Records
   - Support for tags and versioning
   - Comment thread for team discussion

3. Pull Request Review Helper:
   - Page to paste or upload code diffs
   - AI-generated PR summary + review checklist
   - Highlight risky changes (security, performance, infra)

4. Time-Zone Collaboration Planner:
   - Team member time zones
   - Auto-generated best meeting times
   - Leave notes for teammates asynchronously

5. Project Activity Timeline:
   - Real-time feed of commits, tasks moved, ADR changes
   - Filtering by team member, category, date

6. Team Chat / Discussion:
   - Threaded discussions related to tasks or ADRs
   - Mentions, reactions
   - Notification panel

🖥️ Front-End Requirements:
- Framework: React (with TypeScript preferred)
- Pages:
  - Dashboard
  - Task Board
  - ADR Log
  - PR Review Helper
  - Time Zone Planner
  - Activity Feed
  - Profile & Settings
- UI:
  - Modern, clean UI (use TailwindCSS or Material UI)
  - WCAG 2.2 accessibility compliance
  - Implement lazy loading, code splitting, tree shaking
  - Lighthouse score > 90

🗄️ Back-End Requirements:
Use AWS Serverless:
- API Gateway (REST)
- AWS Lambda functions (Node.js or Python)
- DynamoDB for all data:
  • Tasks
  • Architecture Decisions
  • PR Review Notes
  • Users
  • Time zones and profile data
- Cognito User Pool for sign-in/sign-up
- S3 for storing any uploaded files/diffs
- SQS for asynchronous background jobs (like notifications)
- ElastiCache Redis (optional) for caching frequent reads

🔧 Other Requirements:
- Generate all Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK or SAM.
- Include a clean, organized project folder structure.
- Produce buildspec.yml and appspec.yml for CI/CD.
- Add placeholder Lambda logic and sample test data.
- Create reusable components and hooks in React.
- Provide sample API Gateway routes.
- Write comments and instructions in code.

📦 Output:
1. Full project folder structure
2. React front-end code (components, pages, routes)
3. All Lambda function handlers
4. DynamoDB table definitions
5. CDK/SAM IaC templates for deployment
6. Example JSON data
7. Example API requests
8. A README explaining:
   - features
   - setup steps
   - how to run locally
   - how to deploy on AWS

Make sure the code is production-ready, modular, typed (if TypeScript), clean, and easy for a team to expand.
